## Report Data Grouping, AMOUNT Parameter, and Time Calculation Logic

- **Data Grouping**: The report data is organized based on the closure date of each pull request.
- **Using AMOUNT Parameter**: When `AMOUNT` is specified without `REPORT_DATE_START`, the report includes the specified number of most recently modified pull requests. However, the report count may be less than the `AMOUNT` specified, as it only includes merged pull requests.

- **Excluding Weekends and Non-Working Hours**: The calculations for the report exclude weekends. Furthermore, when `CORE_HOURS_START` and `CORE_HOURS_END` are set, time outside of these core working hours is not considered in the time-related metrics.
