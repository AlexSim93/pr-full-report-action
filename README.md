This GitHub Action, **pull-request-analytics-action**, is an essential tool for any team seeking to optimize their software development process, ensuring more efficient and effective project management.

## Getting started

To integrate **pull-request-analytics-action** into your GitHub repository, use the following steps. The provided code is a template and can be adjusted to fit your specific requirements:

1. **Create a Workflow File**:

   - Navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
   - Create a YAML file, for example, `pull-request-analytics.yml`.

2. **Choose the Trigger Event**: Decide on which GitHub event you want to trigger the report generation. You can refer to the [GitHub Events Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) for a detailed understanding of different events. I recommend using one of the `pull_request`, `workflow_dispatch`, or `schedule` events, depending on your specific needs. For this setup, we will configure the `workflow_dispatch` event.

3. **Insert and Customize the Workflow Code**:

   - Open your new YAML file and paste the following example workflow. This is a starting template and you can modify it as needed:

     ```yaml
     name: "PR Analytics"
     on:
       workflow_dispatch:
         inputs:
           amount:
             description: "Amount of PRs"

           report_date_start:
             description: "Report date start(d/MM/yyyy)"
             required: false

             description: "Report date end(d/MM/yyyy)"
             required: false
           aggregate_value_methods:
             description: "Aggregate value methods for timelines separated by comma. Can take values average, percentile, median√è"
             default: "percentile"
           percentile:
             description: "Percentile"
             required: false
             default: "75"

     ```

   - In the `workflow_dispatch` section of the yml file, I have specified various inputs that can be adjusted each time the action is triggered. By utilizing the `required` and `default` fields, I've designated whether each input is mandatory and set predetermined values for ease of use. In the `with` section, I've included parameters that remain constant for each action run. For a detailed understanding of which parameters the action accepts and their functions, please refer to the [Parameters Overview section](#configuration-parameters-overview).
   - Adjust parameters to match your project's needs.

4. **Commit and Push the Workflow File**:

   - Save your changes and commit the file to your repository.
   - Push it to enable the GitHub Action workflow.

5. **Run the Workflow**:

   - In your repository, go to the 'Actions' tab.
   - Select **PR analytics** and start it via "Run workflow".
   - Fill in any necessary parameters and execute the action.

6. **Review the Generated Report**:
   - Once the action completes, your detailed PR report will be available.
   - If configured, check for a new issue in the specified repository containing the report.

This setup allows you to fully leverage **pull-request-analytics-action** for comprehensive PR analysis, tailored to your project‚Äôs needs.

## Detailed Report on Discussion Types

To obtain a detailed report on the types of open discussions, it is necessary to include a specific label in the first message of each discussion, enclosed in double square brackets (`[[ ]]`). For example, use `[[Performance issue]]` to categorize a discussion as related to performance issues. The action will then provide a breakdown of discussions based on these labels, allowing for a more targeted and categorized analysis of discussion topics.

**Example Usage**:

- In the first comment of a pull request discussion, include a label like `[[Bug]]`, `[[Feature Request]]`, or any custom label of your choice.
- **pull-request-analytics-action** will recognize these labels and include them in the report, providing a categorized overview of discussions.

This feature enhances the analytical capabilities of **pull-request-analytics-action**, offering a deeper insight into the nature and distribution of discussions in your pull requests.

## Report Data Grouping, AMOUNT Parameter, and Time Calculation Logic

- **Data Grouping**: The report data is organized based on the closure date of each pull request.
- **Using AMOUNT Parameter**: When `AMOUNT` is specified without `REPORT_DATE_START`, the report includes the specified number of most recently modified pull requests. However, the report count may be less than the `AMOUNT` specified, as it only includes merged pull requests.

- **Excluding Weekends and Non-Working Hours**: The calculations for the report exclude weekends. Furthermore, when `CORE_HOURS_START` and `CORE_HOURS_END` are set, time outside of these core working hours is not considered in the time-related metrics.
