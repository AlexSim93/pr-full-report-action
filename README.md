## Getting started

To integrate **pull-request-analytics-action** into your GitHub repository, use the following steps. The provided code is a template and can be adjusted to fit your specific requirements:

1. **Create a Workflow File**:

   - Navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
   - Create a YAML file, for example, `pull-request-analytics.yml`.

2. **Choose the Trigger Event**: Decide on which GitHub event you want to trigger the report generation. You can refer to the [GitHub Events Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) for a detailed understanding of different events. I recommend using one of the `pull_request`, `workflow_dispatch`, or `schedule` events, depending on your specific needs. For this setup, we will configure the `workflow_dispatch` event.

3. **Insert and Customize the Workflow Code**:

   - Open your new YAML file and paste the following example workflow. This is a starting template and you can modify it as needed:

     ```yaml
     name: "PR Analytics"
     on:
       workflow_dispatch:
         inputs:
           amount:

           report_date_start:
             description: "Report date start(d/MM/yyyy)"
             required: false
           report_date_end:
             description: "Report date end(d/MM/yyyy)"
             required: false
           aggregate_value_methods:
             description: "Aggregate value methods for timelines separated by comma. Can take values average, percentile, medianÏ"
             default: "percentile"
           percentile:
             description: "Percentile"
             required: false
             default: "75"
           issue_title:

               HIDE_USERS: ${{ inputs.hide_users }}
     ```

   - In the `workflow_dispatch` section of the yml file, I have specified various inputs that can be adjusted each time the action is triggered. By utilizing the `required` and `default` fields, I've designated whether each input is mandatory and set predetermined values for ease of use. In the `with` section, I've included parameters that remain constant for each action run. For a detailed understanding of which parameters the action accepts and their functions, please refer to the [Parameters Overview section](#configuration-parameters-overview).
   - Adjust parameters to match your project's needs.

4. **Commit and Push the Workflow File**:

   - Save your changes and commit the file to your repository.
   - Push it to enable the GitHub Action workflow.

5. **Run the Workflow**:

   - In your repository, go to the 'Actions' tab.
   - Select **PR analytics** and start it via "Run workflow".
   - Fill in any necessary parameters and execute the action.

6. **Review the Generated Report**:

   - Once the action completes, your detailed PR report will be available.
   - If configured, check for a new issue in the specified repository containing the report.

This setup allows you to fully leverage **pull-request-analytics-action** for comprehensive PR analysis, tailored to your project’s needs.

## Detailed Report on Discussion Types

To obtain a detailed report on the types of open discussions, it is necessary to include a specific label in the first message of each discussion, enclosed in double square brackets (`[[ ]]`). For example, use `[[Performance issue]]` to categorize a discussion as related to performance issues. The action will then provide a breakdown of discussions based on these labels, allowing for a more targeted and categorized analysis of discussion topics.

**Example Usage**:

- In the first comment of a pull request discussion, include a label like `[[Bug]]`, `[[Feature Request]]`, or any custom label of your choice.
- **pull-request-analytics-action** will recognize these labels and include them in the report, providing a categorized overview of discussions.

This feature enhances the analytical capabilities of **pull-request-analytics-action**, offering a deeper insight into the nature and distribution of discussions in your pull requests.

## Pull Request Sizes

**Calculating PR Size**: The size of a pull request is determined using the formula: `additions + deletions * 0.5`. This calculation considers both the lines of code added and a weighted count of deletions to assess the overall size.

Based on this calculation, pull requests are categorized into the following size brackets:

- `0-50`: `xs`
- `51-200`: `s`
- `201-400`: `m`
- `401-700`: `l`
- `701+`: `xl`

## Report Data Grouping, AMOUNT Parameter, and Time Calculation Logic

- **Data Grouping**: The report data is organized based on the closure date of each pull request.
- **Using AMOUNT Parameter**: When `AMOUNT` is specified without `REPORT_DATE_START`, the report includes the specified number of most recently modified pull requests. However, the report count may be less than the `AMOUNT` specified, as it only includes merged pull requests.

- **Excluding Weekends and Non-Working Hours**: The calculations for the report exclude weekends. Furthermore, when `CORE_HOURS_START` and `CORE_HOURS_END` are set, time outside of these core working hours is not considered in the time-related metrics.

## Configuration Parameters Overview

Below is a table outlining the various configuration parameters available for **pull-request-analytics-action**. These parameters allow you to customize the behavior of the action to fit your specific needs. Each parameter's name, description, requirement status, and default value (if applicable) are listed for your reference:
